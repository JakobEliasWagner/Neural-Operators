# Neural-Operators
*Master's Thesis by Jakob Wagner*

## Setup
I recommend setting up a python venv.

Install the required packages and libraries
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Hooks
Install the pre-commit package manager:
```shell
pip install pre-commit
```
Install the git hook scripts
```shell
pre-commit install
```
now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit `.
